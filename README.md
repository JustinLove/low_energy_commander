# Low Energy Commander

The commander generates very little energy (300).

Expectation is that this will be used with other mods like Extremely Efficient Engineers that reduce build costs or otherwise adjust the economy.

Based on the titans commander, which grants celestial vision.

## Development

The generated project includes a `package.json` that lists the dependencies, but you'll need to run `npm install` to download them.

PA will upload **all files** in the mod directory, including `node_modules` and maybe even `.git` - you probably don't want to use this in `server_mods` directly, unless you really like waiting.  The template is set up run to run as a project within a peer directory of `server_mods` - I use `server_mods_dev/mod_name`.  The task `grunt copy:mod` will copy the mod files to `../../server_mods/identifier`, you can change the `modPath` in the Gruntfile if you want to run it from somewhere else.

### Available Tasks

- copy:mod - copy the mod files into server_mods
- proc - copy the commander from PA and write a modified version into the mod
- default: proc, copy:mod
